## Cal Poly EE Labs 
Processing experimental data for EE lab classes was a great excuse to practice basic data analysis with Python. Some of the code is quite messy, though it improves over the course of multiple lab classes.

I'm particularly happy with `347-lab2.ipynb` (inverter voltage transfer characteristics + programmatically finding $V_{OH}$, $V_{IH}$, and other such inverter figures of merit).

**Classes covered:** EE 346 (Semiconductor Devices), EE 347 (Digital Electronics)
