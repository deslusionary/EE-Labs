## Cal Poly EE Labs 
Processing experimental data for EE lab classes was a great excuse to practice basic data analysis with Python. Some of the code is quite messy, though it improves over the course of multiple lab classes.

**Classes covered:** EE 346 (Semiconductor Devices), EE 347 (Digital Electronics)
